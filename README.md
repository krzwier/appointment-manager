# appointment-manager

Web app for managing veterinary appointments.  Created with React.  My goal with this project was to learn how to build a React app with all functional components, using only hooks.

I followed the LinkedIn Learning tuturial [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-building-an-interface-8551484?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A593715e0498e9e9be7fb8506&u=42520596).
